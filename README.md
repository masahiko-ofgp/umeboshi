[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/masahiko-ofgp/umeboshi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/masahiko-ofgp/umeboshi)

Umeboshi is japanese apricot pickles. I like :)

This application is my interactive shell.

However, this application has just started to develop, 
and does not have any particular functions.

Now, umeboshi has 5 commands.

- echo
- quit
- help
- version
- sum

## Example

    $ cargo run --bin example
